#summary User guide for the Java mapper library.


==Configuration Parameters==
You can set the following in your configuration to customize mapper behavior:

|| *key* || **default value** || **explanation** ||
|| mapreduce.mapper.inputprocessingrate || 1000 || The aggregate number of entities processed per second by all mappers. Used to prevent large amounts of quota being used up in a short time period. ||
|| mapreduce.mapper.shardcount || 8 || The number of concurrent workers to use. This also determines the number of shards to split the input into. ||
|| mapreduce.appengine.donecallback.url || None || A url in the format accepted by the task queue constructor to call after the mapper job is completed. The given url is sent a POST request with a paremeter of job_id, set to the completed MR's job ID. || 

There are additional configuration options defined in the [http://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/source/browse/trunk/java/src/com/google/appengine/tools/mapreduce/AppEngineJobContext.java AppEngineJobContext] class.

Additionally, each input format has its own configuration options:

There is currently only one input format: [http://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/source/browse/trunk/java/src/com/google/appengine/tools/mapreduce/DatastoreInputFormat.java DatastoreInputFormat]. Its options are:

|| *key* || **default value** || **explanation** ||
|| mapreduce.mapper.inputformat.datastoreinputformat.entitykind || None || The datastore entity to map over. ||

== Batch Datastore Mutations ==

You can use the [http://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/source/browse/trunk/java/src/com/google/appengine/tools/mapreduce/DatastoreMutationPool.java DatastoreMutationPool] class to batch datastore puts or deletes. A !DatastoreMutationPool with the default thresholds is available from the [http://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/source/browse/trunk/java/src/com/google/appengine/tools/mapreduce/AppEngineMapper.java AppEngineMapper.AppEngineContext] class, which is accessible using the !AppEngineMapper.getAppEngineContext() method.

== Current Java Limitations ==
The following limitations apply to the current implementation. We're working to remove all of them:
  * Only full range scan is supported, i.e. it's impossible to scan some entity subset.
